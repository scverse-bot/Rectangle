Rectangle embodies a ”second-generation” deconvolution methodology, setting itself apart from other second-generation
methods through its efficiency in signature creation and its handling of challenges within the deconvolution process.
To establish a precise deconvolution method, we employ a hierarchical analysis approach, incorporate mRNA bias
correction, and provide an estimation of unknown cellular content.
